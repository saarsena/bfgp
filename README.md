# BFGP - Barebones Framework for Game Prototyping

**Author**: Scott Arsenault

**License**: MIT

## üöÄ Overview
BFGP is a high-performance, tile-based game engine prototype written in C++ using SDL2, EnTT, and a TMX map parser. It‚Äôs designed as a flexible foundation for building roguelikes, tactical RPGs, or simulation games with modding support and a fast, terminal-driven workflow.

## üîß Features
- ‚úÖ TMX map loading with multiple layers, tilesets, and objects
- ‚úÖ Integrated hot-reloading system for maps
- ‚úÖ Turn- and tick-based scheduler system using EnTT
- ‚úÖ Real-time and turn-based ready
- ‚úÖ Modular architecture for clean expansion

## üõ† Getting Started

### Requirements
- CMake 3.16+
- SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, SDL2_mixer
- TmxParser (https://github.com/libgdx/tiled/tree/master/tools/libtmx)
- A C++20-capable compiler (Clang or GCC recommended)

### Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/bfgp.git
cd bfgp
cmake -B build
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
./build/scheduler_demo
```

### Example
When you run the demo, it:
- Loads a `.tmx` map
- Prints tile and layer info
- Hot-reloads maps as you edit and save in Tiled
- Moves a player character using SDL input

## üß† Philosophy
This project emphasizes clarity and low overhead. It‚Äôs meant to be dissected, hacked, and evolved ‚Äî a kind of spiritual successor to Zachtronics design ethos, tailored for procedural storytelling.

## üìÅ Project Layout
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/                # Your TMX maps and tilesets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ include/              # EnTT and Tmx headers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                  # Core engine source files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.cpp              # Entry point with demo usage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CMakeLists.txt        # Build configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE               # MIT license
```

## ü§ù Contributing
This is currently a solo dev project. Fork away, mod it, ship it ‚Äî and let me know if you build something rad!

Let‚Äôs prototype some weird, beautiful shit.
